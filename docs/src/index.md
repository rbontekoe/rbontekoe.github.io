# Our Story

![AppliGate](/rbontekoe.github.io/logo5.png)

AppliGate is an IT-Training & Consultancy company in the Netherlands.

## History
AppliGate became known in 1986 with the course `Hardware Beheer PC`, a class where people learned to fix errors that occurred with PCs. In 1994 AppliGate started as Lotus Authorized Education Center, LAEC, with instructor-led Lotus Notes & Domino training. IBM XPages training in 2009. In 2014 we stopped by delivering these courses due to decreasing demand. After first experimenting with Scala, we decided to switch to Julia in July 2019.

## Our Focus
AppliGate is developing online courses,
- with [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and Python as programming languages, and
- IoT in mind.

## Why?
We discovered that Julia is a programming language that is easy to learn. It also supports Jupyter Notebooks (IJulia), ideal for experimenting with Julia via a browser. Two packages make it easy to create online course material:
- [Documenter.jl](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/): Learning material and documentation.
- [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl): IJulia notebooks as teaching material.

## Course Development
Currently, we are developing the 'course' [Building Business Applications with Julia](https://rbontekoe.github.io/BAWJ/). Our goal is to build the software for a modular based system:
- Using Docker,
- the Onion architecture, and
- Machine Learning.

## Languages and Tools
- Julia;
- Flask/Python;
- Atom;
- Git;
- Docker;
- Raspberry Pi Zero W;
- Raspberry Pi 3B;
- Google Kubernetes Engine.
