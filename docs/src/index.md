# Our Story

![AppliGate](/rbontekoe.github.io/logo5.png)

AppliGate is an IT-Consultancy company in the Netherlands.

## History
AppliGate became known in 1986 with the course `Hardware Beheer PC`, a class where people learned to fix errors that occurred in PCs. In 1994 AppliGate started as Lotus Authorized Education Center, LAEC, with instructor-led Lotus Notes & Domino training. In 2014 we stopped by delivering these courses. After first experimenting with Scala we decided to switch to Julia in July 2019.

## Our Focus
AppliGate is developing online courses,
- with [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and Python as programming languages, and
- IoT as the starting point.

## Why?
We discovered that Julia is a programming language that is easy to learn. It also supports Jupyter Notebooks (IJulia), ideal for experimenting with Julia via a browser. Two packages make it easy to create online course material:
- [Documenter.jl](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/). E.g. our first [tutorial](https://rbontekoe.github.io/tutorial_rbo/).
- [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) E.g. our first [notebook](https://github.com/rbontekoe/RbO.jl/blob/master/test.ipynb).

## Current Course Development
Currently, we are developing a course building an [elderly monitoring system](https://rbontekoe.github.io/BAWJ/). Our goal is to deliver the software for a micro-services based system:
- Using Docker,
- the Ports and Adapter (Onion) pattern, and
- machine learning.

## Current Languages and Tools
- Julia;
- Flask/Python;
- Atom;
- Git;
- Docker;
- Raspberry Pi Zero W;
- Raspberry Pi 3B;
- Google Kubernetes Engine.
