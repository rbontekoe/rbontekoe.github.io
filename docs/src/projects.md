# Current Projectas

## Online course

We started with the project 'rbontekoe/RbO.jl.' to build up experience with Julia, based on the ports and adapter design pattern. The publisher-subscriber model was chosen, which resulted in the RbO.jl package. With Documenter.jl we wrote the [documentation](https://rbontekoe.github.io/RbO.jl/) for the module. It also gave us the idea to write courses with Documenter.jl, and developed a [tutorial](https://rbontekoe.github.io/tutorial_rbo/) as test.

There are many online-courses nowadays. Most are excellent, but our objectives are that the content mainly consists of videos, but a syllabus is missing. We want to try to combine these two: videos in a curriculum. The first step is to come up with a clear course example.

## Elderly Monitoring

This project will be based on a similar project with Scala.
