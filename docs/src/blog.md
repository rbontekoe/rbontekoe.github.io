Why not build a website with Documenter.jl. We did it today. When you go to [AppliGate](https://rbontekoe.github.io), you enter our new site. In the meantime, we got more experience with Julia. E.g., we resized Rob's picture with Images.jl. It was straightforward.

````julia
julia> using Images

julia> img = load("rob.png")

julia> img2 = imresize(img, ratio=0.5)

julia> save("rob2.png", img2)
````
