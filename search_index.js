While playing with it, I realized that it could solve my CQRS and Event Sourcing problem. With the method serialize, you can create a text representation of an object, that you can store. With deserialize, you do the reverse. Serialize writes to an IOStream, and deserialize reads from it. An IOStream can be an IOBuffer or a file. It makes Event Sourcing easier.","category":"page"},{"location":"blog/#","page":"Blog","title":"Blog","text":"I also looked at channels. You can use channels to communicate between processes.

I realized that the domain objects I wanted to keep must have an identification code. So Subscriber, Publisher, and Message got an id. To create the id, I used the hash function with a name and time as a parameter. It had consequences for the documentation. In the example code, I used the tag 'jldoctest,' so Documenter could test the example code during the generation of the manual. Because the ids keep changing, I had to give up. Too bad, because I found that a strong point of Documenter.jl. I replaced the test tag 'jldoctest' with the language tag 'julia.' Maybe there is something to do against continually changing values.","category":"page"},{"location":"blog/#","page":"Blog","title":"Blog","text":"Infected by the CQRS thought, I decided to add changed domain objects to the database instead of modifying an existing record.","category":"page"},{"location":"employees/#Employees-1","page":"Employees","title":"Employees","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"employees/#Rob-Bontekoe-1","page":"Employees","title":"Rob Bontekoe","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"employees/#","page":"Employees","title":"Employees","text":"(Image: Rob Bontekoe) Rob founded AppliGate in 1985.
