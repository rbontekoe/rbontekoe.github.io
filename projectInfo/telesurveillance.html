<h1>Telesurveillance project</h1>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this project is to expand my Scala knowledge, which I gained through the projects 'surveillance' and 'web project (Play)'. In this project I use Akka Actor, Akka Remote and Cluster. The software will be distributed over a laptop and several Raspberry Pi's.</br>Planning from the learning point of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify Domain Driven Design code 'surveillance' to Actors (Done).</li>
<li>Set up the complete Actor System (Done).</li>
<li>Working with 'real' images (Done).</li>
<li>Setting up a cluster of Raspberry Pi's (Backlog).</li>
<li>Working with Slack (Doing).</li>
<li>Implementing Machine Learning with Scala/Spark (Backlog).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>With this project, I have been able to deepen my knowledge considerably. I also got some valuable advice from Mariano Navas. Meanwhile, I am beginning to feel comfortable with Scala/Akka and would qualify myself as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Driven Design (ports and adapters/onion pattern) - Good.</li>
<li>Scala - Good.</li>
<li>Functional programming - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Actor design - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Remoting - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Cluster - Reasonably well.</li>
<li>Actor Unit testing - Further research.</li>
<li>Akka Streams - Reasonably well.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Python 3 - Reasonably well.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Scala/Spark - Further research.</li>
<li>Docker on Raspberry Pi 3 - Good.</li>
</ul>
