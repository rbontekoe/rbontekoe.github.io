<h1>Telesurveillance project</h1>
<h3>Status update Scala/Akka</h3>
<p>My study project. With this project, I have been able to deepen my knowledge considerably. I also got some valuable advice from Mariano Navas. Meanwhile, I am beginning to feel comfortable with Scala/Akka and would qualify myself as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Driven Design (ports and adapters pattern) - Good.</li>
<li>Scala - Good.</li>
<li>Functional programming - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Actor design - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Cluster design - Reasonably well.</li>
<li>Actor Unit testing - Further research.</li>
<li>Spark - Further research.</li>
<li>Machine Learning - Reasonably well (in Python 3).</li>
<li>Docker - Good (Raspberry Pi 3).</li>
</ul>
