<h1>Telesurveillance project</h1>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>To expand my Scala knowledge, which I gained through 'surveillance' and 'web project'. In this project I use Akka Actor and Akka Cluster. The software will be distributed over a laptop and several Raspberry Pi's. Planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify Domain Driver Design code 'surveillance' to Actors (ready).</li>
<li>Set up the complete Actor System (2018-01-10 partly done).</li>
<li>Working with 'real' images.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>With this project, I have been able to deepen my knowledge considerably. I also got some valuable advice from Mariano Navas. Meanwhile, I am beginning to feel comfortable with Scala/Akka and would qualify myself as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Driven Design (ports and adapters/onion pattern) - Good.</li>
<li>Scala - Good.</li>
<li>Functional programming - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Actor design - Good.</li>
<li>Akka Cluster design - Reasonably well.</li>
<li>Actor Unit testing - Further research.</li>
<li>Spark - Further research.</li>
<li>Machine Learning - Reasonably well (in Python 3).</li>
<li>Docker - Good (Raspberry Pi 3).</li>
</ul>
