<h1>Surveillance project</h1>
<p>The best way for me to learn is by doing. Scala is new to me, so I came up with this project.</p>

<p>The goal is to create a system to monitor elderly persons in a nursing home. The system consists of Raspberry Pi Zero W hardware equipped with a camera and a central monitoring system. Currently, I vision the system as publisher/subscriber system, where Zero W devices post images. The system should raise the alarm where an elderly has not seen for a particular time after entering a room. The Zero W will have Python/Flask software and periodically send images to the central monitoring system. The central observing system will be built with Scala and process the images using an object recognition module to identify people.</p>

<p>So far the basic structure has been created using Scala with Play and Akka.</p>

<p>How to implement the object recognition part? How to detect whether a person is in a right or bad state? I will use Python because I have experience with Python and Machine learning, and decided to start with face recognition</p>

<p>I have implemented face recognition in a Docker container on my Raspberry Pi. I used Adam Geitgey's library <a href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition">Face recognition</a> after reading his article <a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78">Machine Learning is Fun! Part 4: Modern Face Recognition with Deep Learning</a>. The application works well.</p>
